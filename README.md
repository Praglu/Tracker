# Tracker
Django back-end made for an Issue Tracker - API

#### Front-end for this API: https://github.com/dereniowskid885/project-tracker

In this project a PostgreSQL Data Base is a must have.
If you haven't one go to 
### settings.py
uncomment lines 89-92
and comment 93-100
You need to uncomment line 23 with the SECRET KEY

After downloading Django and Django Rest Framework with pip navigate to project folder ( in this case "tracker" )
Then run shell/terminal and write:

### python manage.py runserver

After this command you should get an information about 
### Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

If U want to stop the server press
### Ctrl+c

Have fun!
